#Courses backend project

Probably my most ambitious project doing by miself, resulted in much dead code, even more commented code, but after all of that a successful backend! It has SQL tables linked with Postrges, it has the Admin, a profesor and students, validates what they can do while using JWT, i also used Sequalize for the SQL work, a really solid foundation for api building in node.js all in all. Not yet done, as it needs to get some makeup to be prettier, and I am planning to make a frontend for it so that it can go live! I had many problems, from the html pages not working, and then i discarded them, to not understanding how jwt works so i tried doing it with express-sessions, to not even knowing what im coding in controllers, but after digging some material and studying it i actually understood what it was all about and what i'm doing, and it turned out great!
All in all i learned probably the most concepts on this project ever, i learned Sequelize, i learned JWT, i learned API building in Node and routing them, i learned making postman calls to localhost, using BCrypt and syncing the whole backend in one with the Users and what they can do based on their authorizations, but all in all it was and still is a fun project, i will be continuing it right after finishing the Personal Portfolio. 

Hope you enjoy it even a fraction as much as i did reader!
